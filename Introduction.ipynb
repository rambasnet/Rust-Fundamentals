    "\n",
    "## Rust Programming Language\n",
    "\n",
    "- compiled strongly-typed programming language\n",
    "- combines performance and reliability\n",
    "- designed for safety and concurrency\n",
    "- memory safety without garbage collection\n",
    "- zero-cost abstractions\n",
    "- ownership system\n",
    "- powerful type system\n",
    "- modern syntax\n",
    "- growing ecosystem\n",
    "- used in systems programming, web development (WebAssembly - Wasm), game development, Infrastructure & Cloud, embedded systems, and more\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Rust?\n",
    "\n",
    "- performance: comparable to C and C++\n",
    "- safety: prevents common bugs like null pointer dereferencing and buffer overflows\n",
    "- concurrency: built-in support for concurrent programming\n",
    "- modern syntax: easy to read and write\n",
    "- growing ecosystem: many libraries and tools available\n",
    "- strong community: active and welcoming community of developers    \n",
    "- used by companies like Mozilla, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and more\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Rust\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rust can be installed using the `rustup` tool, which is the recommended way to install Rust. \n",
    "- It allows you to manage multiple versions of Rust and associated tools easily.\n",
    "- To install Rust using `rustup`, follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Open a terminal and run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process. You can choose the default installation\n",
    "3. After the installation is complete, you may need to restart your terminal or run the following command to update your PATH environment variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source $HOME/.cargo/env\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. To verify that Rust is installed correctly, you can run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "rustc --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This should display the version of Rust that you have installed. \n",
    "- You can also check the version of Cargo, Rust's package manager, by running:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cargo --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "- With Rust installed, you can now start writing and running Rust code!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing Rust in Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebooks are a popular tool for interactive programming and data analysis.\n",
    "- You can use Rust in Jupyter Notebooks by installing the `evcxr_jupyter` kernel, which allows you to write and execute Rust code directly in your notebooks.\n",
    "- install jupyter notebook if you haven't already:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install the evcxr_jupyter kernel for Rust in Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "-  Use Rust's package manager, Cargo, to install the kernel from crates.io.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    " cargo install evcxr_jupyter\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- After the installation is complete, you need to register the kernel with Jupyter. Run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "evcxr_jupyter --install\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This will set up the Rust kernel for Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "- You can also install VS Code extensions for Jupyter Notebooks to enhance your experience when working with Rust in notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Or, you can start Jupyter Notebooks by running:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the Jupyter interface, you can create a new notebook and select \"Rust\" as the kernel to start writing and executing Rust code in your notebook cells. \n",
    "- You can use the same Rust syntax and features as you would in a regular Rust program, and the output will be displayed directly in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Cargo to Manage Rust Projects\n",
    "- Cargo is Rust's package manager and build system. It helps you manage your Rust projects,\n",
    "handle dependencies, and automate the build process.\n",
    "- To create a new Rust project using Cargo, you can use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
