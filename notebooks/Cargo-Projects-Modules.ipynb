    "# Cargo Build System\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager, which helps manage dependencies, compile code, and run tests\n",
    "- It uses a file called `Cargo.toml` to specify project metadata, dependencies, and build configuration\n",
    "- Cargo makes it easy to share and reuse code by allowing you to publish libraries to crates.io, Rust's package registry\n",
    "- It also provides a convenient way to run tests, benchmarks, and examples, making it an essential tool for Rust development\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Project Structure\n",
    "- A typical Rust project managed by Cargo has the following structure:\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_project/\n",
    "├── Cargo.toml\n",
    "├── Cargo.lock\n",
    "├── src/\n",
    "│   └── main.rs\n",
    "│   └── util.rs\n",
    "├── tests/ # (optional integration tests)\n",
    "│    └── test_integration.rs # \n",
    "├── target/ # (generated by Cargo, contains compiled artifacts)\n",
    "└── README.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### What each file does:\n",
    "- `Cargo.toml`: This file contains the project metadata, dependencies, and build configuration. It is the main configuration file for Cargo.\n",
    "- example `Cargo.toml` content:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "[package]\n",
    "name = \"my_project\"\n",
    "version = \"0.1.0\"\n",
    "edition = \"2026\"\n",
    "\n",
    "[dependencies]\n",
    "rand = \"0.8\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Cargo.lock`: This file is automatically generated by Cargo and contains the exact versions of dependencies used in the project. It ensures that the same versions are used across different builds and environments.\n",
    "- `src/`: This directory contains the source code of the project. The `main.rs` file is the entry point for binary projects, while library projects typically have a `lib.rs` file. You can also have additional modules like `util.rs` for organizing code into separate files.\n",
    "- `tests/`: This directory is used for unit/integration tests. Each file in this directory is compiled as a separate crate and can contain tests that use the public API of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Cargo to Manage Rust Projects\n",
    "- Cargo helps you manage your Rust projects, handle dependencies, and automate the build process.\n",
    "- To create a new Rust project using Cargo, you can use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "(base) ╭─rbasnet@M-rbasnetMBP ~/projects/Rust-Fundamentals ‹main●›\n",
    "╰─$ cd demos\n",

    "    Creating binary (application) `hello_world` package\n",

    "## Cargo Modules\n",
    "- In Rust, a module is a way to organize code into namespaces. It allows you to group related functions, structs, enums, and other items together. Modules can be defined in separate files or within the same file using the `mod` keyword. \n",
    "- Modules help improve code organization and readability by providing a clear structure for your codebase. \n",
    "- They also allow you to control the visibility of items, making it easier to manage the public API of your library or application.\n",
    "- To define a module in a separate file, you can create a new file with the same name as the module and use the `mod` keyword to include it in your main file. For example, if you have a module named `util`, you can create a file named `util.rs` and include it in your `main.rs` like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "mod util;\n",
    "```\n",
    "- You can then use the items defined in the `util` module by referencing them with the module name, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "util::some_function();\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `::` is the path separator in Rust, used to access items within modules\n",
    "- To make items in a module public and accessible from outside the module, you can use the `pub` keyword. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "pub fn some_function() {\n",
    "    // function implementation\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This allows you to call `util::some_function()` from other parts of your code or even from other modules that import `util`.\n"
