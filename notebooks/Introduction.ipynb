    "## Why Rust?\n",
    "\n",
    "- performance: comparable to C and C++\n",
    "- safety: prevents common bugs like null pointer dereferencing and buffer overflows\n",
    "- concurrency: built-in support for concurrent programming\n",
    "- modern syntax: easy to read and write\n",
    "- growing ecosystem: many libraries and tools available\n",
    "- strong community: active and welcoming community of developers    \n",
    "- used by companies like Mozilla, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and more\n",

    "## Run Rust code in Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "- You can run Rust code in Jupyter Notebooks by creating a new notebook and selecting the Rust kernel. \n",
    "- In the notebook cells, you can write Rust code and execute it to see the output directly in the notebook without the main function or Cargo project structure"

    "- A Rust program consists of a collection of items, which can be functions, structs, enums, traits, and more. \n",
    "- The `main` function is the entry point of a Rust program, and it is where the execution of the program begins. \n",
    "- The `main` function is defined using the `fn` keyword, followed by the name of the function (in this case, `main`), and a pair of parentheses that can optionally contain parameters.\n",
    "- The body of the `main` function is enclosed in curly braces `{}` and contains the code that will be executed when the program runs. \n",
    "- The `main` function is a special function in Rust, and it is required for every Rust program. "
