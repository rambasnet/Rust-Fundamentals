    "# Wat is Owenship in Rust?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ownership is a unique feature of Rust that manages memory safety without a garbage collector\n",
    "- It allows developers to write efficient and safe code by enforcing rules on how memory is allocated and deallocated\n",
    "- In Rust, every value has a single owner, and when the owner goes out of scope, the value is automatically dropped, freeing the memory\n",
    "- This system helps prevent common programming errors such as null pointer dereferencing and memory leaks\n",
    "- Rust compiler checks ownership rules at compile time, ensuring that code adheres to these principles and is memory safe\n",
    "    - if any ownership rules are violated, the code will not compile, providing a strong guarantee of memory safety\n",
    "- ownership is a new concept for many programmers, it does take some time to get used to"

    "\n",

    "- The HEAP is managed by Rust's ownership system\n",
    "- When a value is allocated on the HEAP, it is owned by a variable, and when that variable goes out of scope, the memory is automatically freed\n",
    "- This allows Rust to manage memory safely without a garbage collector, preventing memory leaks and dangling pointers\n",
    "- heap is less organized and slower to access than the STACK, so it's generally more efficient to use the STACK for small, short-lived data and the HEAP for larger, long-lived data\n",
    "- the HEAP can grow and shrink dynamically, but it can also lead to fragmentation if not managed properly, which can reduce performance over time\n",
    "    - think of the HEAP as a pile of plates, where you can add or remove plates from anywhere in the pile\n",
    "\n",
    "### STACK Segment\n",
    "- The STACK segment is used for function call frames, local variables, and return addresses\n",
    "- Each time a function is called, a new frame is pushed onto the STACK, and when the function returns, the frame is popped off\n",
    "- The STACK grows towards the lower address or HEAP region\n",
    "- The STACK is organized and fast to access, making it ideal for small, short-lived data\n",
    "- However, the STACK has a limited size, and if too much data is allocated on the STACK, it can lead to a stack overflow\n",
    "- local variables and function parameters are typically pushed on the STACK in LIFO (Last In, First Out) order, meaning the most recently called function's variables are at the top of the STACK\n",
    "- when a function returns, its frame is popped off the STACK, and the memory used by its local variables is freed automatically\n",
    "- think STACK as a stack of plates, where you can only add or remove the top plate"
