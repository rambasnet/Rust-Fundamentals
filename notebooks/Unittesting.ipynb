    "# Unittest\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unittests are a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation to ensure that they work as expected.\n",
    "- In Rust, unittests are typically written using the built-in testing framework, which allows developers to write test functions that can be run automatically to verify the correctness of their code. \n",
    "- Unittests help catch bugs early in the development process and ensure that code changes do not break existing functionality.\n",
    "- Rust deliberately encourages unit tests inside the same file as the code being tested, which promotes better organization and makes it easier to maintain tests alongside the implementation.\n",
    "- tests are run with `cargo test` and are only compiled when testing, so they do not affect the performance of the release build.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two important tests \n",
    "- Unit tests: test the internal logic of a module, often accessing private functions and fields to ensure that the implementation is correct.\n",
    "- Integration tests: test the public API of a module, ensuring that it behaves correctly from the perspective of an external user, without relying on internal implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Unit tests are meant to test implementation details\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unit tests ≠ integration tests.\n",
    "- Rust splits testing into two levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Test Type        | Purpose                | Location        |\n",
    "| ---------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |\n",
    "| Unit test        | Verify internal logic  | Same file       |\n",
    "| Integration test | Verify public behavior | `tests/` folder |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "// db.rs\n",
    "\n",
    "pub fn parse_id(s: &str) -> u32 {\n",
    "    s.parse().unwrap()\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "#[cfg(test)]\n",
    "mod tests {\n",
    "    use super::*;\n",
    "\n",
    "    #[test]\n",
    "    fn parses_valid_id() {\n",
    "        assert_eq!(parse_id(\"42\"), 42);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- inside the same file, tests can access private functions and fields, which allows for more comprehensive testing without exposing internal details to the public API\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "fn normalize(x: i32) -> i32 { x.abs() } // private\n",
    "\n",
    "#[cfg(test)]\n",
    "mod tests {\n",
    "    use super::*;\n",
    "\n",
    "    #[test]\n",
    "    fn negative_becomes_positive() {\n",
    "        assert_eq!(normalize(-5), 5);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "- If tests were outside the file → impossible without making everything public, which would break encapsulation and lead to a less maintainable codebase\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Prevents accidental API exposure\n",
    "\n",
    "- In many languages developers do this:\n",
    "    - “I need to test it… fine I’ll make it public.”\n",
    "- Rust forbids that design shortcut.\n",
    "- Keeping tests inside the module means:\n",
    "- private functions stay private\n",
    "- API stays minimal\n",
    "- refactoring stays safe\n",
    "- This is huge for library stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Tests stay close to logic (maintenance advantage)\n",
    "\n",
    "- When code changes:\n",
    "    - modify function → tests are 5 lines below\n",
    "    - Instead of:\n",
    "        - modify function → search 12 directories for tests\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rust favors local reasoning — you should understand a module in one place.\n",
    "- This drastically reduces stale tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Compiled only during testing (zero runtime cost)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Because of:\n",
    "\n",
    "```rust\n",
    "#[cfg(test)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The compiler literally removes the test module from release builds.\n",
    "- So you get the following benefits for free:\n",
    "    - documentation\n",
    "    - safety\n",
    "    - examples\n",
    "    - verification\n",
    "- No runtime cost, no binary bloat.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5) Encourages documentation-style testing mindset\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rust treats tests as part of the module specification.\n",
    "- You’re expected to read a module like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "code\n",
    "↓\n",
    "examples/tests\n",
    "↓\n",
    "guarantees\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Almost like executable comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6) Faster compilation model\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rust builds a special test binary where each module brings its own tests.\n",
    "- That means:\n",
    "    - no reflection\n",
    "    - no runtime discovery\n",
    "    - parallel execution\n",
    "\n",
    "- Putting tests with modules simplifies compilation dependency graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple mental model\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rust modules are units of correctness\n",
    "- Not just folders.\n",
    "- So:\n",
    "    - A module without tests is considered unfinished.\n",
    "\n",
    "- And the most natural place for correctness proofs\n",
    "- is right next to the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- see `demos/unitest` folder for examples of unit tests in Rust.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- Rust’s design encourages writing unit tests inside the same file as the code being tested, which promotes better organization, encapsulation, and maintainability.\n",
    "- This approach allows developers to test private functions and fields without exposing them to the public API, ensuring that the internal logic of a module can be thoroughly tested while keeping the API minimal and stable.\n",
    "- Additionally, tests are only compiled during testing, so they do not affect the performance of the release build, and this design encourages a documentation-style testing mindset where tests serve as executable examples of how the code should behave."
